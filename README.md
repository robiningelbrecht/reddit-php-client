# Reddit PHP client

*Disclaimer*: This is not a complete Reddit client. It's an example of a client used by my bot.
The bot scans several subreddits for screenshots and cross-post them to a dedicated subreddit of my own.

## Install

```
composer install robiningelbrecht/reddit-php-client
```

The file `example.php` contains the actual code of the bot. 
It should contain all the code you need to get you started.

If you liked my approach, consider giving this repo a :star:
